I am a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sargent/academics/departments-programs/speech-language-hearing-sciences/">Department of Speech, Language & Hearing Sciences</a> at Boston University, working in the <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/crespolab/">Bilingual Learning Lab</a> with Kimberly Crespo, PhD CCC-SLP. I completed my PhD in psychology at the <a href="https://psych.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin–Madison<a/> with Jenny Saffran. 

My work focuses on individual differences in early word meanings. For example, I ask: when we consider a child’s knowledge of a particular word, what do they actually know, and how might they have learned it? Our earliest experiences with language and the world—such as whether we ate mashed or whole bananas—shape our understanding of words. I aim to understand whether and how these early experiences give rise to differences in word meanings. To do so, I use mixed-method designs: I explore children’s naturalistic word-learning environments through caregiver-report surveys, and I examine children’s word knowledge using eye-tracking experiments with both familiar and novel words.
