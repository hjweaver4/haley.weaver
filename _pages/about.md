I study how infants' and young children's early experiences give rise to individual differences in word learning. I use caregiver report and eye tracking methods to measure different aspects of word knowledge including semantic knowledge and lexical processing efficiency.

I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Speech, Language & Hearing Sciences (https://www.bu.edu/sargent/academics/departments-programs/speech-language-hearing-sciences/) at Boston University, working in the Bilingual Learning Lab (https://sites.bu.edu/crespolab/) with Kimberly Crespo, PhD CCC-SLP. I completed my PhD in psychology at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison with Jenny Saffran.
